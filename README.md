# INFX 551 Foundations of Data Curation

This is our class repository. It includes - lecture slides, acitivities, and data.

Next steps: 

1. `Fork` this repository 
2. Add me `nniiicc`  and your teammates as a collaborator 
3. Change this read me file (see note below on markdown). Add the title of your project, and a brief description.
4. Go to `Settings` and make sure the `Issues` box is checked. (This allows your forked repository to have its own set of issues)

There are a number of folders, and I suggest keeping the file strucutre as I have arranged it. This inlcudes: 

1. Code: You can put any software that you have used for your final project. This is 100% optional - you may not use or write any code for this project. 
2. Data: Add curated datasets - more specific instructions forthcoming
3. Documentation: Any additional documentaiton (data dictionary, etc.) should go here. 
4. Final Report: [Directions](https://github.com/OpenDataLiteracy/INFX-551-Spring2017/wiki/How-To:-Final-Project-Deliverables)
5. Use-Cases: For your second assignment you will write up a use-case following the W3C format for Data on the Web Best Practices. The use-case will be related to the quarter project, so I'd like you to place all of these in the same folder. If you write this document as a `.doc` you can use an online [tool](https://word-to-markdown.herokuapp.com/) to convert to markdown `.md`. 


New to Github? Cool - we'll go over this in Week 2. Be sure to sign-up for a Github account before that date.

New to Markdown?  This is a really simple syntax for writing documentation. Markdown is a lot like editing a Wikipedia page - here is a great [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
