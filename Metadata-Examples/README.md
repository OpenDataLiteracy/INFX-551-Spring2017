This folder contains metadata to be used in class exercises.
You can preview these files in GitHub, but it will likely be useful to download and open them on your desktop.

To do so, you might download a plaintext editor - I recommend [ATOM.IO](https://atom.io/) - it is a lightweight and relatively easy to use plaintext editor that will support both XML and JSON validation.

1. [Houston Air Quality metadata in PDF](http://data.ohouston.org/dataset/tceq-air-quality-monitoring-sites/resource/83ecc147-0c8c-445e-bfea-0938ce02bc07)

A PDF is included in this folder. By comparison, look at [Air Quality data for NYC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Air-Quality/c3uy-2p5r)

2. [National Household Education Survey, 1999 from ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/3607?q=Recycling)  

This includes DATS in XML and JSON; MARC in XML; Dublin Core in XML, and; DDI in XML

3. [Recycling Dropoff Centers (City of Chicago)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/recycling-dropoff-sites)

DCAT + PODM standards in JSON ... (Interesting question - What is this metadata describing? take a look at the link above...)

4. [Farmers Markets Directory and Geographic Data from Department of Ag](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/farmers-markets-geographic-data)

(? Standard) in JSON + XML  ... Same as above, what is this metadata describing? Does the webpage offer any better info?
